        SKIP TO CONTENT\n\n\n\n\nA half-trillion dollars is starting to work its way
        through the US economy, remaking climate technology along the way. \n\nOne
        year ago, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, marking the most
        significant action on climate change to date from the federal government.
        The legislation set aside hundreds of billions of dollars to support both
        new and existing technologies—from solar panels and heat pumps to batteries
        for electric vehicles—in an effort to slash costs for clean technologies and
        cut greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.\n\nRelated Story\nHere
        are the biggest technology wins in the breakthrough climate bill\n\nThe bill
        includes $369 billion in spending on climate and energy.\n\nExperts say the
        IRA has already begun making waves across the economy, most visibly through
        a steady stream of company announcements unveiling new manufacturing facilities
        in the US. However, the most significant effects from the legislation are
        still to come, as many of the programs are designed to last for a decade or
        longer. There are even some remaining questions about how key pieces of the
        bill will play out, including which projects will be eligible for heavily
        debated tax credits for hydrogen fuel.\n\nHere''s what you need to know about
        where US policy on climate technology stands after one year of the Inflation
        Reduction Act, and what to watch for next.\n\nSo far: private companies are
        hopping in\n\nThe IRA includes hundreds of billions in grants, loans, and
        tax credits that will transform industries including energy, transportation,
        and agriculture. The funds will flow to technologies at several stages of
        development, supporting new research along with manufacturing and deployment
        of more established technologies.\n\nWhen details about the then-bill were
        first reported  in late July 2022, estimates put the total climate funding
        in the Inflation Reduction Act at $369 billion, making it the largest US investment
        in climate technology to date. An updated evaluation from the Joint Committee
        on Taxation in April 2023 estimated  total government investment in the IRA
        of  $515 billion from  2023 through  2032, though that figure doesn’t include
        all the law’s programs, such as consumer tax credits for electric vehicles.  \n\nMuch
        of the expected hundreds of billions in spending hasn’t arrived yet, and getting
        all that funding out the door will take a while to rev up, says Ben King,
        associate director of energy and climate at Rhodium Group, a policy and research
        nonprofit.\n\nRelated Story\nMeet the new batteries unlocking cheaper electric
        vehicles\n\nA planned factory marks a major milestone in the US for new batteries
        that enable lower-cost, longer-lasting EVs.\n\nMany of the tax credits will
        start to make it to businesses after they file their taxes for 2023. Some
        of the largest chunks of money fall into this category, including an estimated
        $30 billion in tax credits for companies installing clean energy projects
        like wind and solar farms and $60 billion in tax incentives for companies
        manufacturing equipment like solar panels and batteries for electric vehicles.\n\nTax
        credits for companies can tilt the scales, making it more favorable to do
        business in the US—which should spur private funding and create jobs, says
        Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, senior resident fellow for the climate and energy program
        at Third Way, a public policy think tank.\n\nThe IRA includes both tax credits
        that help cover part of the cost of major investments like building a new
        factory, as well as others that help subsidize production of products like
        batteries. So some provisions in the bill can help lower upfront costs, while
        others promise to pay for a percentage of each product a company produces.
        \n\nEven though funding has barely started to go out, the promise of this
        massive pot of money has been enough to spur a seemingly endless stream of
        news from companies looking to take advantage of new incentives by building
        or expanding manufacturing for clean energy and transportation projects in
        the US.\n\n“There really isn’t a day that goes by without an announcement,”
        Hughes-Cromwick says. \n\nSince the IRA was passed on August 16, 2022, companies
        have collectively announced $76 billion in investments for facilities based
        in the US, according to a tracker run by Jack Conness, a policy analyst at
        Energy Innovation.\n\nAnd while the list of planned projects includes sites
        that will produce components for solar panels, wind turbines, and electricity
        transmission equipment, the majority of announcements have been for companies
        that are part of the EV and battery supply chains. \n\nPart of the reason
        for the high concentration of battery announcements can be attributed to an
        additional set of tax credits for individuals purchasing electric vehicles;
        these credits are good for up to $7,500 toward purchase of a new EV. \n\nTo
        qualify for EV tax credits, vehicles have to meet requirements related to
        where their batteries and materials are sourced (mostly from the US or free
        trade agreement partners). So buyers might ultimately pay less for an EV that’s
        sourced mostly in the US. These restrictions are intended to push more companies
        to source materials and manufacture vehicles in the US. And so far, it seems
        to be working.\n\nRelated Story\nUS minerals industries are booming. Here’s
        why.\n\nDavid Turk, the Energy Department’s number two, says that recent US
        climate policies are creating jobs and accelerating the nation’s shift to
        clean energy.\n\nIn total, there have been 62 announced projects with a combined
        $53 billion in planned private funding just for EV and battery projects since
        the IRA became law, as tallied by another tracker run by Wellesley College
        energy researcher Jay Turner. So many multibillion-dollar battery projects
        have been announced across the Midwest and Southeast that a region stretching
        from Michigan to Georgia has earned a new nickname, the Battery Belt.\n\nMost
        of the projects that have been announced since the IRA was passed are still
        in the planning phases, though some, including a $3.5 billion joint venture
        between Honda and LG Energy Solution that was announced in October 2022, have
        already broken ground. Benefits for people in those regions are still to come,
        but should include well-paying jobs coming to local and regional communities,
        says Anand Gopal, executive director of policy research at Energy Innovation.\n\n“There
        is still a long way to go, but the initial signs, particularly in manufacturing,
        have been very good,” Gopal says.   \n\nLooking ahead: more details, and emissions
        cuts\n\nThe IRA is a fairly comprehensive document—the text is hundreds of
        pages long. But despite all those details, and the fact that it was released
        over a year ago, there are still questions remaining about several of the
        key programs in the law.\n\nOne key question just after the bill was signed,
        for example, was how strictly restrictions in the tax credits would be interpreted.
        The EV tax credits required that materials and components be sourced from
        either the US or free trade agreement partners, but it wasn’t immediately
        clear from the law’s text how the percentage of US-based materials and components
        would be calculated. \n\nWe’re still in the early days.\n\nEllen Hughes-Cromwick\n\nIt’s
        been up to the Internal Revenue Service to fill in the gaps. So far, it seems
        like the agency is taking a lenient approach with the clarifications it’s
        issued on those credits, King says. \n\nHowever, there’s still an open question
        about how the agency will define one more clause in the EV tax credits, which
        exclude vehicles that include a “foreign entity of concern” as part of the
        supply chain. There’s a chance this could be used to target China, which controls
        the vast majority of several parts of EV manufacturing, including battery
        material refining and component manufacturing, King says. Those restrictions,
        which are due to kick in starting in 2024, could limit the vehicles that are
        eligible for tax credits, depending on how they’re interpreted, which could
        result in less funding for EVs and even fewer EV customers as a result.\n\nOne
        of the thornier open questions of the IRA concerns a tax credit program for
        hydrogen.\n\nHydrogen has a wide range of potential applications for climate
        technology: it can be used as an alternative fuel for planes or vehicles,
        and it’s also used to produce chemicals like ammonia, which is used in fertilizer.
        Today, hydrogen is produced almost entirely using fossil fuels. But hydrogen
        can also be generated using electricity—and when that electricity comes from
        renewable sources like wind and solar, it results in “green hydrogen,” a low-emissions
        fuel. \n\nThe IRA includes tax incentives for green hydrogen. However, details
        about which projects should qualify will be critically important, Gopal says.
        Many electrolyzers that make hydrogen using electricity aren’t hooked up directly
        to a solar panel or wind turbine. Instead, they’re connected to the electrical
        grid, which can be powered by a mix of sources. \n\nGenerating hydrogen using
        electricity from a grid that’s primarily powered by fossil fuels could actually
        wind up increasing overall emissions. So incentives for hydrogen require “more
        care” than technologies like EVs that nearly always result in emissions cuts,
        Gopal says. \n\nRules about which hydrogen sources would be eligible for a
        cut of IRA funds were due to come out within one year after the IRA’s passing.
        But the Biden administration missed that deadline. The rules are now set to
        be delayed at least until October, and it could be December before there’s
        more clarity on this key program. \n\nMeanwhile, how all these new funding
        sources will translate into emissions reductions is still theoretical. Analysts
        and researchers estimate that the IRA could help the US reach a 40% reduction
        in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. That still falls short of the target
        set in international agreements to reduce emissions by half, but it’s a significant
        improvement for the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gas emissions.
        \n\nAll the funding in the IRA is a significant downpayment on climate action
        for the US, Hughes-Cromwick says. Already, private companies are plowing billions
        into new climate technology efforts. As more public and private funding flows
        into manufacturing and deployment, that can unlock lower prices and higher
        uptake of the technologies that can help address climate change, she adds.
        “We’re still in the early days … look at what we’ve seen after one year. Can
        you imagine what we’re going to see with 10 years of this support?”\n\nhide\n\nPOPULAR\nCovid

        which are due to kick in starting in 2024, could limit the vehicles that are
        eligible for tax credits, depending on how they’re interpreted, which could
        result in less funding for EVs and even fewer EV customers as a result.\n\nOne
        of the thornier open questions of the IRA concerns a tax credit program for
        hydrogen.\n\nHydrogen has a wide range of potential applications for climate
        technology: it can be used as an alternative fuel for planes or vehicles,
        and it’s also used to produce chemicals like ammonia, which is used in fertilizer.
        Today, hydrogen is produced almost entirely using fossil fuels. But hydrogen
        can also be generated using electricity—and when that electricity comes from
        renewable sources like wind and solar, it results in “green hydrogen,” a low-emissions
        fuel. \n\nThe IRA includes tax incentives for green hydrogen. However, details
        about which projects should qualify will be critically important, Gopal says.
        Many electrolyzers that make hydrogen using electricity aren’t hooked up directly
        to a solar panel or wind turbine. Instead, they’re connected to the electrical
        grid, which can be powered by a mix of sources. \n\nGenerating hydrogen using
        electricity from a grid that’s primarily powered by fossil fuels could actually
        wind up increasing overall emissions. So incentives for hydrogen require “more
        care” than technologies like EVs that nearly always result in emissions cuts,
        Gopal says. \n\nRules about which hydrogen sources would be eligible for a
        cut of IRA funds were due to come out within one year after the IRA’s passing.
        But the Biden administration missed that deadline. The rules are now set to
        be delayed at least until October, and it could be December before there’s
        more clarity on this key program. \n\nMeanwhile, how all these new funding
        sources will translate into emissions reductions is still theoretical. Analysts
        and researchers estimate that the IRA could help the US reach a 40% reduction
        in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. That still falls short of the target
        set in international agreements to reduce emissions by half, but it’s a significant
        improvement for the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gas emissions.
        \n\nAll the funding in the IRA is a significant downpayment on climate action
        for the US, Hughes-Cromwick says. Already, private companies are plowing billions
        into new climate technology efforts. As more public and private funding flows
        into manufacturing and deployment, that can unlock lower prices and higher
        uptake of the technologies that can help address climate change, she adds.
        “We’re still in the early days … look at what we’ve seen after one year. Can
        you imagine what we’re going to see with 10 years of this support?”\n\nhide\n\nPOPULAR\nCovid
