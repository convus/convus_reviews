        half-trillion dollars is starting to work its way through the US economy,
        remaking climate technology along the way. \n\nOne year ago, the Inflation
        Reduction Act was signed into law, marking the most significant action on
        climate change to date from the federal government. The legislation set aside
        hundreds of billions of dollars to support both new and existing technologies—from
        solar panels and heat pumps to batteries for electric vehicles—in an effort
        to slash costs for clean technologies and cut greenhouse gas emissions that
        cause climate change.\n\nRelated Story\nHere are the biggest technology wins
        in the breakthrough climate bill\n\nThe bill includes $369 billion in spending
        on climate and energy.\n\nExperts say the IRA has already begun making waves
        across the economy, most visibly through a steady stream of company announcements
        unveiling new manufacturing facilities in the US. However, the most significant
        effects from the legislation are still to come, as many of the programs are
        designed to last for a decade or longer. There are even some remaining questions
        about how key pieces of the bill will play out, including which projects will
        be eligible for heavily debated tax credits for hydrogen fuel.\n\nHere''s
        what you need to know about where US policy on climate technology stands after
        one year of the Inflation Reduction Act, and what to watch for next.\n\nSo
        far: private companies are hopping in\n\nThe IRA includes hundreds of billions
        in grants, loans, and tax credits that will transform industries including
        energy, transportation, and agriculture. The funds will flow to technologies
        at several stages of development, supporting new research along with manufacturing
        and deployment of more established technologies.\n\nWhen details about the
        then-bill were first reported  in late July 2022, estimates put the total
        climate funding in the Inflation Reduction Act at $369 billion, making it
        the largest US investment in climate technology to date. An updated evaluation
        from the Joint Committee on Taxation in April 2023 estimated  total government
        investment in the IRA of  $515 billion from  2023 through  2032, though that
        figure doesn’t include all the law’s programs, such as consumer tax credits
        for electric vehicles.  \n\nMuch of the expected hundreds of billions in spending
        hasn’t arrived yet, and getting all that funding out the door will take a
        while to rev up, says Ben King, associate director of energy and climate at
        Rhodium Group, a policy and research nonprofit.\n\nRelated Story\nMeet the
        new batteries unlocking cheaper electric vehicles\n\nA planned factory marks
        a major milestone in the US for new batteries that enable lower-cost, longer-lasting
        EVs.\n\nMany of the tax credits will start to make it to businesses after
        they file their taxes for 2023. Some of the largest chunks of money fall into
        this category, including an estimated $30 billion in tax credits for companies
        installing clean energy projects like wind and solar farms and $60 billion
        in tax incentives for companies manufacturing equipment like solar panels
        and batteries for electric vehicles.\n\nTax credits for companies can tilt
        the scales, making it more favorable to do business in the US—which should
        spur private funding and create jobs, says Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, senior resident
        fellow for the climate and energy program at Third Way, a public policy think
        tank.\n\nThe IRA includes both tax credits that help cover part of the cost
        of major investments like building a new factory, as well as others that help
        subsidize production of products like batteries. So some provisions in the
        bill can help lower upfront costs, while others promise to pay for a percentage
        of each product a company produces. \n\nEven though funding has barely started
        to go out, the promise of this massive pot of money has been enough to spur
        a seemingly endless stream of news from companies looking to take advantage
        of new incentives by building or expanding manufacturing for clean energy
        and transportation projects in the US.\n\n“There really isn’t a day that goes
        by without an announcement,” Hughes-Cromwick says. \n\nSince the IRA was passed
        on August 16, 2022, companies have collectively announced $76 billion in investments
        for facilities based in the US, according to a tracker run by Jack Conness,
        a policy analyst at Energy Innovation.\n\nAnd while the list of planned projects
        includes sites that will produce components for solar panels, wind turbines,
        and electricity transmission equipment, the majority of announcements have
        been for companies that are part of the EV and battery supply chains. \n\nPart
        of the reason for the high concentration of battery announcements can be attributed
        to an additional set of tax credits for individuals purchasing electric vehicles;
        these credits are good for up to $7,500 toward purchase of a new EV. \n\nTo
        qualify for EV tax credits, vehicles have to meet requirements related to
        where their batteries and materials are sourced (mostly from the US or free
        trade agreement partners). So buyers might ultimately pay less for an EV that’s
        sourced mostly in the US. These restrictions are intended to push more companies
        to source materials and manufacture vehicles in the US. And so far, it seems
        to be working.\n\nRelated Story\nUS minerals industries are booming. Here’s
        why.\n\nDavid Turk, the Energy Department’s number two, says that recent US
        climate policies are creating jobs and accelerating the nation’s shift to
        clean energy.\n\nIn total, there have been 62 announced projects with a combined
        $53 billion in planned private funding just for EV and battery projects since
        the IRA became law, as tallied by another tracker run by Wellesley College
        energy researcher Jay Turner. So many multibillion-dollar battery projects
        have been announced across the Midwest and Southeast that a region stretching
        from Michigan to Georgia has earned a new nickname, the Battery Belt.\n\nMost
        of the projects that have been announced since the IRA was passed are still
        in the planning phases, though some, including a $3.5 billion joint venture
        between Honda and LG Energy Solution that was announced in October 2022, have
        already broken ground. Benefits for people in those regions are still to come,
        but should include well-paying jobs coming to local and regional communities,
        says Anand Gopal, executive director of policy research at Energy Innovation.\n\n“There
        is still a long way to go, but the initial signs, particularly in manufacturing,
        have been very good,” Gopal says.   \n\nLooking ahead: more details, and emissions
        cuts\n\nThe IRA is a fairly comprehensive document—the text is hundreds of
        pages long. But despite all those details, and the fact that it was released
        over a year ago, there are still questions remaining about several of the
        key programs in the law.\n\nOne key question just after the bill was signed,
        for example, was how strictly restrictions in the tax credits would be interpreted.
        The EV tax credits required that materials and components be sourced from
        either the US or free trade agreement partners, but it wasn’t immediately
        clear from the law’s text how the percentage of US-based materials and components
        would be calculated. \n\nWe’re still in the early days.\n\nEllen Hughes-Cromwick\n\nIt’s
        been up to the Internal Revenue Service to fill in the gaps. So far, it seems
        like the agency is taking a lenient approach with the clarifications it’s
        issued on those credits, King says. \n\nHowever, there’s still an open question
        about how the agency will define one more clause in the EV tax credits, which
        exclude vehicles that include a “foreign entity of concern” as part of the
        supply chain. There’s a chance this could be used to target China, which controls
        the vast majority of several parts of EV manufacturing, including battery
        material refining and component manufacturing, King says. Those restrictions,
        which are due to kick in starting in 2024, could limit the vehicles that are
        eligible for tax credits, depending on how they’re interpreted, which could
        result in less funding for EVs and even fewer EV customers as a result.\n\nOne
        of the thornier open questions of the IRA concerns a tax credit program for
        hydrogen.\n\nHydrogen has a wide range of potential applications for climate
        technology: it can be used as an alternative fuel for planes or vehicles,
        and it’s also used to produce chemicals like ammonia, which is used in fertilizer.
        Today, hydrogen is produced almost entirely using fossil fuels. But hydrogen
        can also be generated using electricity—and when that electricity comes from
        renewable sources like wind and solar, it results in “green hydrogen,” a low-emissions
        fuel. \n\nThe IRA includes tax incentives for green hydrogen. However, details
        about which projects should qualify will be critically important, Gopal says.
        Many electrolyzers that make hydrogen using electricity aren’t hooked up directly
        to a solar panel or wind turbine. Instead, they’re connected to the electrical
        grid, which can be powered by a mix of sources. \n\nGenerating hydrogen using
        electricity from a grid that’s primarily powered by fossil fuels could actually
        wind up increasing overall emissions. So incentives for hydrogen require “more
        care” than technologies like EVs that nearly always result in emissions cuts,
        Gopal says. \n\nRules about which hydrogen sources would be eligible for a
        cut of IRA funds were due to come out within one year after the IRA’s passing.
        But the Biden administration missed that deadline. The rules are now set to
        be delayed at least until October, and it could be December before there’s
        more clarity on this key program. \n\nMeanwhile, how all these new funding
        sources will translate into emissions reductions is still theoretical. Analysts
        and researchers estimate that the IRA could help the US reach a 40% reduction
        in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. That still falls short of the target
        set in international agreements to reduce emissions by half, but it’s a significant
        improvement for the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gas emissions.
        \n\nAll the funding in the IRA is a significant downpayment on climate action
        for the US, Hughes-Cromwick says. Already, private companies are plowing billions
        into new climate technology efforts. As more public and private funding flows
        into manufacturing and deployment, that can unlock lower prices and higher
        uptake of the technologies that can help address climate change, she adds.
        “We’re still in the early days … look at what we’ve seen after one year. Can
        you imagine what we’re going to see with 10 years of this support?”\n\nhide\n\nPOPULAR\nCovid

        1: What was the first major action the article mentions on climate change
        from the federal government?\n\nTrue option: One year ago, the Inflation Reduction
        Act was signed into law.\n\nFalse option: The article does not mention any
        major federal action on climate change.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, signed
        into law one year ago, marked the most significant federal action on climate
        change to date, according to the article. The legislation set aside hundreds
        of billions of dollars to support clean technologies like solar panels and
        electric vehicles. \n\nStep 2: How much total government investment does the
        article say is included in the Inflation Reduction Act? \n\nTrue option: An
        April 2023 estimate put total government investment from the IRA at $515 billion
        from 2023 through 2032.\n\nFalse option: The article does not provide an estimate
        of total government investment from the IRA.\n\nThe article states that an
        updated evaluation from April 2023 estimated total government investment in
        the IRA of $515 billion from 2023 through 2032. This figure doesn''t include
        all of the law''s programs.\n\nStep 3: What effect has the promise of funding
        from the IRA already had, according to the article?\n\nTrue option: It has
        prompted many company announcements about new manufacturing facilities in
        the US. \n\nFalse option: It has not had any noticeable effects so far.\n\nThe
        article says that even though much of the expected spending from the IRA hasn''t
        arrived yet, the promise of the funding has already spurred many companies
        to announce new manufacturing facilities in the US to take advantage of the
        incentives.\n\nStep 4: What region of the US has the article said is attracting
        many new EV and battery facilities?\n\nTrue option: A region dubbed the Battery
        Belt stretching from Michigan to Georgia.\n\nFalse option: The West Coast.
        \n\nThe article states that so many multibillion-dollar battery projects have
        been announced in the Midwest and Southeast that the region from Michigan
        to Georgia has earned the nickname the Battery Belt.\n\nStep 5: What does
        the article say is still unclear about the EV tax credits in the IRA?\n\nTrue
        option: How a clause about excluding vehicles with supply chains linked to
        \"foreign entities of concern\" will be interpreted. \n\nFalse option: There
        are no major outstanding questions about the EV tax credits.\n\nAccording
        to the article, there is still uncertainty around how a clause in the EV tax
        credits excluding vehicles with supply chains linked to \"foreign entities
        of concern\" will be interpreted, which could impact vehicle eligibility starting
        in 2024.\n\nStep 6: When does the article say rules are now expected on which
        hydrogen projects can qualify for IRA tax credits?\n\nTrue option: Possibly
        as late as December 2022. \n\nFalse option: The rules were already released.\n\nThe
        article states that rules on which hydrogen projects will qualify for IRA
        tax credits were delayed past the original one-year deadline and are now set
        to come out by October at the earliest, and potentially as late as December
        2022.","stop_reason":"stop_sequence","model":"claude-2.0","stop":"\n\nHuman:","log_id":"bd485b944300c95b684c400718ff87b275390365a632245b99ebdd298b425e7c"}'
