The site is styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - loaded via Play CDN - [read about configuration here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn)

I've had good experiences with the [Flowbite component library](https://flowbite.com/), which provides components for Tailwind, e.g.

- [accordion](https://flowbite.com/docs/components/accordion/)
- [stepper](https://flowbite.com/docs/components/stepper/)).
